# STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM...NOW WE'RE HERE
***

A little about me...

Way back in 2001, I stumbled across a local government funded organization that offered free classes in a number of different fields with the only criteria being that you had to be a resident of the city of Detroit, MI and between the ages of 18 and 24. I was specifically drawn to the two technology classes they offered which were PC repair and web development. I remember one of the career counselors mentioned how difficult it would be to get a position as a web developer (some things never change) as the industry was still trying to recover from the Dot-com bubble bursting, but that I should learn about buy domains and selling them to larger companies as a way to make easy money. Ultimately, I choose to learn PC repair and spent every moment of every hour learning everything I could.

After completing the program, I took and passed the compTIA A+ exam after a few months of study. Back then, the ceritifications were good for life, so you never had to worry about them expiring.

In 2016, I decided to make the journey into the exciting field of professional web development and was able to land a job after about a year of self-taught learning.

## Lists

Unordered

+ Create a list by starting a line with `+`, `-`, or `*`
+ Sub-lists are made by indenting 2 spaces:
  - Marker character change forces new list start:

    + Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet
    - Nulla volutpat aliquam velit
+ Very easy!

Ordered

1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
2. Consectetur adipiscing elit
3. Integer molestie lorem at massa


1. You can use sequential numbers...
1. ...or keep all the numbers as `1.`

Start numbering with offset:

57. foo
1. bar


## Code

Inline `code`

Indented code

    // Some comments
