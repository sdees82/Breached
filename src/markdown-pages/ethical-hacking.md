I recently purchased "Practical Ethical Hacking - The Complete Course" by Heath Adams from Udemy after I came across the course as a recommendation on Twitter and decided to work through the course of the next few weeks. One of the topics included in the course that I'll cover in the blog post are the 5 stages of ethical hacking.

The 5 major steps are:

**Step 1 - Reconnaissance:** This involves gathering as much information as possible about a target. Target validation is extremely important in ensuring you are going after the correct target. This step consist of two types:
+ Passive Reconnaissance - Indirectly obtaining information from public sources (ie. social media, google, public websites)
+ Active Reconnaissance - Directly interacting with the target to obtain information. 

**Step 2 - Scanning & Enumeration:** This step involves scanning a target for weaknesses or vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This includes such processes as port scanning, vulnerability scanning and network mapping.

**Step 3 - Exploitation:** This step involves actually compromising the system or network using a variety of different tools such as Metasploit.

**Step 4 - Maintaining Access:** Maintaining access is the process of creating persistant access to the system or network. This can be done through the use of rootkits or other methods.

**Step 5 - Covering Tracks:** Covering tracks involves deleting logs of the intrusion, uninstalling applications or deleting anything that could be used alert a user that the system was compromised.

##RECONNISANCE

As stated earlier reconnisance is the act of gaining as much information about a target as possible. This is without a doubt the most important step of ethical hacking as you wouldn't want to run the risk of intruding on the wrong system or network, which could lead to big trouble.

We can use a number of different methods in order to pinpoint the correct targets and that includes social media and google sesrches.
