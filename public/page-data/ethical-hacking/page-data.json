One of the topics included in the course that I'll cover in the blog post are the 5 stages of ethical hacking.</p>\n<p>The 5 major steps are:</p>\n<p><strong>Step 1 - Reconnaissance:</strong> This involves gathering as much information as possible about a target. Target validation is extremely important in ensuring you are going after the correct target. This step consist of two types:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Passive Reconnaissance - Indirectly obtaining information from public sources (ie. social media, google, public websites)</li>\n<li>Active Reconnaissance - Directly interacting with the target to obtain information. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Step 2 - Scanning &#x26; Enumeration:</strong> This step involves scanning a target for weaknesses or vulnerabilities that can be exploited. This includes such processes as port scanning, vulnerability scanning and network mapping.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 3 - Exploitation:</strong> This step involves actually compromising the system or network using a variety of different tools such as Metasploit.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 4 - Maintaining Access:</strong> Maintaining access is the process of creating persistant access to the system or network. This can be done through the use of rootkits or other methods.</p>\n<p><strong>Step 5 - Covering Tracks:</strong> Covering tracks involves deleting logs of the intrusion, uninstalling applications or deleting anything that could be used alert a user that the system was compromised.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>RECONNISANCE</h2>\n<p>As stated earlier reconnisance is the act of gaining as much information about a target as possible. This is without a doubt the most important step of ethical hacking as you wouldn't want to run the risk of intruding on the wrong system or network, which could lead to big trouble.</p>\n<p>We can use a number of different methods in order to pinpoint the correct targets and that includes social media and google sesrches. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"The 5 Stages Of Ethical Hacking","date":"08/22/2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/ethical-hacking/"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
